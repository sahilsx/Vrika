As I mentioned before, FileInfo is a class that provides functions to work with files. Here are some of the functions with code examples:
- Create: Creates a file in the specified path.

FileInfo fi = new FileInfo(@"C:\Test\TestFile.txt");
fi.Create();

- Delete: Deletes the file.

FileInfo fi = new FileInfo(@"C:\Test\TestFile.txt");
fi.Delete();

- MoveTo: Moves the file to a new location.

FileInfo fi = new FileInfo(@"C:\Test\TestFile.txt");
fi.MoveTo(@"C:\NewTest\NewTestFile.txt");

- CopyTo: Copies the file to a new location.

FileInfo fi = new FileInfo(@"C:\Test\TestFile.txt");
fi.CopyTo(@"C:\NewTest\NewTestFile.txt");

- Open: Opens the file in a specified mode.

FileInfo fi = new FileInfo(@"C:\Test\TestFile.txt");
FileStream fs = fi.Open(FileMode.OpenOrCreate, FileAccess.ReadWrite, FileShare.None);
// Do some operations on the file stream
fs.Close();

You can find more functions and code examples on these websites   . Do you have any specific questions about FileInfo?
